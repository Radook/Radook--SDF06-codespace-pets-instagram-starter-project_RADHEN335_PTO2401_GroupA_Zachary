# Learning Reflections README

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, i made the closest resemblance to a deskop version of instagram using my very own page as reference. i used mainly grid to get the
page looking as it is.

### Reflections

i struggled quite a bit deciding wether to use flex or grid in most cases, and with the responsiveness that i only remembered to do at the end so it was a bit confusing to impliment grid to that, but that could also been due to me being a bit overwhelmed at some parts and having too much time to take breaks and refresh the brain

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: i feel like there wasnt much need to impliment flex, so i mainly just stuck to grid, some cases i did fumble a bit but i got it soon enough
- **Responsive Design**: this i struggled a bit with first, but after relooking at the course and some examples on google i quickly got it back
- **Styling Elements**: styling is always the most fun and i feel like i got this mostly down to a tee
- **Circle animation**: this was quick and easy to get adn was fun making a nice one to use

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: main stuggle was just getitng the top part with all the bio and picture to how i wanted, it was a struggle at first but i got to it and made me learn some techniques on the way
- **grid vs flex**: i spent way to long debating and experimenting with using both the methods, but i ended up stuggling a lot, so i found out sticking to just grid made it look as i wanted

#### Areas for Improvement

- **grid and flex**: i feel like i need to touch up a little bit more on this, as i feel like i was over thinking a lot of the stuff, but after some revision later i should get it down nicely

#### Overall Learning Experience

it was a rather challanging part, a part that did make it more tough was not writing the html outselves so it felt like working with foreign code, but guess that was also the point ha, so it was challanging but when i finally got to the end, i learnt quite a bit. it was hard at times, but over all it was very fun and nice to make it over this hurdle
